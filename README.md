# Slackbot
This action allows you to post messages to Slack. You can use the simple predefined templates or send raw JSON. Inspired by `pullreminders/slack-action@v1.0.7`

**Disclaimer!**
This was a weekend project, it fits our needs as an organization right now, but certainly could be improved immensly! PRs are welcome and appreciated!
